Organize Docusaurus folders and scripts.\\r\\n2. Define content types in Strapi.\\r\\n3. Write and maintain the bridge script to connect the two.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Docusaurus\\r\\n- **What it is**: A static site generator that builds the front-end documentation site.\\r\\n- **Plugins**:\\r\\n  - **i18n (Internationalization)**:\\r\\n    - Handles translations by associating content with language-specific versions.\\r\\n    - Requires properly structured content.\\r\\n  - **Algolia Search**:\\r\\n    - Enhances search functionality by indexing your documentation and returning relevant results.\\r\\n    - Setup involves:\\r\\n      - Creating an account with Algolia.\\r\\n      - Configuring their crawler for your site.\\r\\n      - Adding API keys and configuration files.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Challenges and Complexities\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Iterative Content Structure**:  \\r\\n  One challenge is that the content isn\u2019t fully developed yet, making it hard to plan the structure in advance. As the content evolves, the bridge script will likely need several iterations to accommodate changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Managing Multiple Documentation Versions**:  \\r\\n  We discussed creating different versions of the documentation website for specific clients or internal use, rather than managing content display through roles.  \\r\\n  - **Strapi**: Needs a clear system to classify content (e.g., tags or fields for version or client).  \\r\\n  - **Bridge Script**: Must dynamically fetch and organize content for each version, increasing complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Sidebar Automation**:  \\r\\n  The content of the sidebars in Docusaurus isn\u2019t as automated as it could be. For now, I have to define the sidebar manually, which adds some extra overhead. I\u2019m sure this feels minor to a developer, but to me, writing scripts is not like breathing!\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Algolia Search Setup**:  \\r\\n  Setting up Algolia is an involved process. While I might be able to configure it on the current setup with GitHub Pages, it\u2019s complex enough that it should be done by someone with more expertise. Additionally, the setup would need to be redone when we move the site to our servers, making it a task better suited for later in the project timeline.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Autonomy vs. Complexity**:  \\r\\n  I\u2019m aiming to stay as independent as possible to avoid delays, but there are limits to my technical capabilities."}]}}')}}]);
